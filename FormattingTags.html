<h1> A Francis turbine consists of the following main parts:</h1>
 
<p><strong>Guide or stay vanes:</strong> The primary functions of the guide or stay vanes is to convert the pressure energy of the fluid into the momentum energy. It also serves to direct the flow at design angles to the runner blades.</p>

<p><b>Runner blades:</b> <i>Runner Blades</i> are the heart of any turbine. These are the centers where the <del>fluid strikes</del> and the tangential force of the impact causes the shaft of the turbine to rotate, producing torque. Close attention in design of blade angles at inlet and outlet is necessary, as these are major parameters affecting <big>Power Production</big>.</p>

<p><b>Draft tube:</b> The <em>Draft Tube</em> is a conduit which connects the runner exit to the tail race where the water is discharged from the turbine. Its primary function is to <ins>reduce the velocity</ins> of discharged water to minimize the loss of <i>kinetic Energy</i> at the outlet. This permits the turbine to be set above the tail water without appreciable drop of available head.</p>
<p><big><strong>Governor:</strong></big> Governing system or governor is the main controller of the hydraulic turbine. The governor varies the water flow through the turbine to control its speed or power output. Generating units speed and system frequency may be adjusted by the <em>Governor</em>. </p>

<h2>Hydraulic efficiency:</h2>
<p>It is the ratio of the power developed by the runner to the water power available at the inlet of turbine.
